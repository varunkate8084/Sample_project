This is a Django web application in which I developed three HTML files for logIn, Registration and for uploading a file. In this I work on models.py file for the database , url.py file for mapping the URLs and also work on view.py file for creating view for the project also use authentication library, User Library ,Login and Logout  which is provided by the DJANGO also worked on "python manage.py makemigrations" command for creating a database in SQLite and also worked on  "python manage.py shell" . In this I used some template engines for becoming a code more easier and easy to understandable . Develop one CSS file for designing and also use Bootstrap and in this somewhere I took help from the  reference code. For run the code you need to install Django and create app in it then you run the makemigrations command for executing the models.py file the you just need to run "runserver" command which helps to run run your code on browser.  

In this project there are lot of things which I have to improve but due to submission deadline its incomplete. But I will complete it gradually.
